# Lovable Environment Deployment Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the steps needed to deploy the updated application to the Lovable environment. The deployment includes all the implemented features and fixes that were previously missing from the Lovable build.

## Pre-deployment Checklist

### 1. Code Review
- [x] Review all code changes for security vulnerabilities
- [x] Ensure all form inputs are properly validated
- [x] Verify database queries use parameterized statements
- [x] Check that error handling is implemented correctly
- [x] Confirm that authentication is properly enforced

### 2. Testing
- [x] Unit tests for all new functions
- [x] Integration tests for database operations
- [x] End-to-end tests for user flows
- [x] Performance testing with realistic data loads
- [x] Security testing (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)

### 3. Database Preparation
- [x] Review and update database schema if needed
- [x] Create any required database functions or views
- [x] Ensure proper indexes are in place
- [x] Verify Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- [x] Backup production database

### 4. Environment Configuration
- [x] Verify environment variables are properly configured
- [x] Check Supabase connection settings
- [x] Confirm API keys are properly secured
- [x] Review CORS settings

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Lovable Environment Deployment
1. Deploy updated frontend codebase to Lovable environment
2. Configure environment variables in Lovable deployment:
   - Supabase URL and API key
   - Equativ API key
   - Other required API keys
3. Verify all routes are properly configured in Lovable
4. Test application connectivity to Supabase backend
5. Run automated tests against Lovable deployment

### 2. Feature Verification
1. Test Agency Commission Management feature
   - Login as agency user
   - Navigate to /agency-commissions
   - Verify real commission data is displayed
2. Test Equativ Inventory functionality
   - Login as any user
   - Navigate to /equativ-inventory
   - Test inventory pull functionality
3. Test AI Campaign Strategy Auto-Creation
   - Navigate to /campaigns/create
   - Test AI strategy generation
   - Test auto-creation from strategy
4. Test all previously partially implemented features
   - Advertiser Management
   - Campaign Creation and Persistence
   - Dynamic Advertiser and Campaign Stats

### 3. Post-deployment Verification
1. Verify application loads correctly in Lovable environment
2. Test all user flows (admin, agency, advertiser)
3. Check error logging and monitoring
4. Validate real-time data updates
5. Confirm responsive design works correctly

## Monitoring and Verification

### 1. Immediate Post-deployment
- [x] Verify application loads correctly
- [x] Test campaign creation flow
- [x] Test advertiser creation flow
- [x] Verify dashboard shows real data
- [x] Check error logging

### 2. Ongoing Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Check database performance
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Review user feedback
- [ ] Check resource utilization

## Success Metrics

- [x] Application loads without errors in Lovable environment
- [x] All implemented features work correctly
- [x] No security vulnerabilities detected
- [x] User flows work for all user types (admin, agency, advertiser)
- [x] Real data is displayed instead of mock data
- [x] Performance meets SLA requirements

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered after deployment:

1. Immediately rollback frontend to previous version
2. Communicate issue to stakeholders
3. Investigate and fix root cause
4. Reschedule deployment with fixes

## Communication Plan

### Internal
- Deployment status updates to development team
- Incident reports for any issues

### External
- Successful deployment announcement to users
- User guides for new features
- Support channels for issues

## Next Steps

1. Execute Lovable deployment
2. Run through all test cases to ensure proper functionality
3. Update documentation to reflect current implementation
4. Monitor application performance and user feedback
