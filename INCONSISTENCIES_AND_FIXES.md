# Application Inconsistencies and Recommended Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the inconsistencies found in the application and the recommended fixes to resolve them. The main issues are related to backend integration, where some components use mock data instead of real data from the database.

## Inconsistencies Identified

### 1. CreateCampaign.tsx
**Issue**: The `launchCampaign` function only logs to the console instead of saving to the database.
**Impact**: Campaigns created by users are not persisted and are lost when the page is refreshed.
**Files Affected**: `src/pages/CreateCampaign.tsx`

### 2. Advertisers.tsx
**Issue**: The `handleCreateAdvertiser` function only logs to the console instead of saving to the database. The component also uses mock data instead of fetching real data from the database.
**Impact**: Advertisers created by users are not persisted and are lost when the page is refreshed. The list of advertisers is not dynamic.
**Files Affected**: `src/pages/Advertisers.tsx`

### 3. Dashboard.tsx
**Issue**: The dashboard uses a mix of real data (from database) and mock data. The performance charts use hardcoded mock data instead of real data from the database.
**Impact**: Users see inaccurate performance data that doesn't reflect their actual campaign performance.
**Files Affected**: `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

## Detailed Analysis

### CreateCampaign.tsx
The CreateCampaign component has a comprehensive form for creating campaigns, but the submission handler only logs the data to the console:

```javascript
const launchCampaign = () => {
  // Validate required fields
  if (!campaignData.name) {
    alert('Please enter a campaign name')
    return
  }
  
  if (!campaignData.advertiserId) {
    alert('Please select an advertiser')
    return
  }
  
  // Create campaign object
  const campaignPayload = {
    ...campaignData,
    dsps: selectedDSPs,
    ssps: selectedSSPs,
    strategy: generatedStrategy,
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
  }
  
  console.log('Launching campaign:', campaignPayload)
  alert('Campaign launched successfully! (This is a demo - in production this would connect to your DSP/SSP APIs)')
  
  // Navigate back to advertiser campaigns page
  navigate(`/advertisers/${campaignData.advertiserId}/campaigns`)
}
```

The component already imports `supabase` and has the necessary infrastructure for database integration, but it's not being used.

### Advertisers.tsx
The Advertisers component uses mock data for the advertisers list:

```javascript
// Mock data for advertisers
const advertisersData = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "TechCorp Solutions",
    industry: "Technology",
    status: "Active",
    campaigns: 12,
    totalSpend: "$125,000",
    contactEmail: "marketing@techcorp.com",
    description: "Leading technology solutions provider",
  },
  // ... more mock data
]
```

The `handleCreateAdvertiser` function only logs to the console:

```javascript
const handleCreateAdvertiser = () => {
  console.log("Creating advertiser:", formData)
  setIsCreateDialogOpen(false)
  setFormData({ name: "", industry: "", contactEmail: "", description: "" })
}
```

### Dashboard.tsx
The Dashboard component fetches real metrics using React Query:

```javascript
const { data: metrics } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["user-metrics", user?.id],
  enabled: !!user?.id,
  queryFn: async () => {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .rpc('get_user_metrics');
    if (error) throw error;
    const row = Array.isArray(data) ? data[0] : null;
    return row as { total_impressions: number; total_clicks: number; total_spend_cents: number; ctr_percent: number } | null;
  },
});
```

However, the performance charts use mock data:

```javascript
const performanceData = [
  { date: '1/1', impressions: 12500, clicks: 125, spend: 245 },
  { date: '1/2', impressions: 15200, clicks: 198, spend: 298 },
  // ... more mock data
]
```

The campaign table fetches real campaign data but shows placeholder values for metrics:

```javascript
<td className="py-4 px-6 font-medium">-</td> {/* Impressions placeholder */}
<td className="py-4 px-6 font-medium">-</td> {/* Clicks placeholder */}
<td className="py-4 px-6 font-medium text-primary">-</td> {/* CTR placeholder */}
<td className="py-4 px-6 font-medium">-</td> {/* CPM placeholder */}
```

## Recommended Fixes

### 1. CreateCampaign.tsx
**Fix**: Implement database integration using Supabase and React Query.
**Steps**:
1. Import `useAuth` hook to get current user
2. Import `useMutation` and `useQueryClient` from `@tanstack/react-query`
3. Import `toast` from `sonner` for notifications
4. Create a mutation function to save campaign data to Supabase
5. Connect form fields to state variables
6. Update `launchCampaign` function to save data to database

### 2. Advertisers.tsx
**Fix**: Implement database integration using Supabase and React Query.
**Steps**:
1. Import `useAuth` hook to get current user
2. Import `useQuery`, `useMutation`, and `useQueryClient` from `@tanstack/react-query`
3. Import `toast` from `sonner` for notifications
4. Create a query to fetch advertisers from database
5. Create a mutation function to save advertiser data to Supabase
6. Update `handleCreateAdvertiser` function to save data to database
7. Update UI to show loading and error states

### 3. Dashboard.tsx
**Fix**: Replace mock data with real data from database.
**Steps**:
1. Create a query to fetch performance data from database
2. Create database functions or views to aggregate performance data
3. Update charts to use real data
4. Update campaign table to show real metrics
5. Add loading and error states for performance data

## Database Schema Considerations

The application already has a well-defined database schema with tables for:
- `profiles` (user management)
- `campaigns` (campaign management)
- `domain_lists` (allowlists/blocklists)
- `frequency_caps` (frequency capping)
- `impression_tracking` (impression tracking)

For the fixes, we'll primarily use:
- `campaigns` table for campaign creation
- `profiles` table with role filtering for advertisers
- New database functions or views for performance data aggregation

## Security Considerations

The application already implements:
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Authentication with Supabase Auth
- Parameterized database queries

The fixes should maintain these security measures by:
- Using existing authentication hooks
- Implementing proper input validation
- Using parameterized queries for all database operations

## Performance Considerations

The application already uses React Query for efficient data fetching and caching. The fixes should:
- Leverage existing React Query infrastructure
- Implement proper pagination for large datasets
- Use database indexes for frequently queried fields
- Consider implementing optimistic updates for better UX

## Testing Considerations

The fixes should be tested for:
- Data persistence (campaigns and advertisers are saved to database)
- Error handling (proper error messages and user feedback)
- Performance (efficient data fetching and rendering)
- Security (proper authentication and authorization)
- User experience (intuitive forms and clear feedback)

## Deployment Considerations

The fixes can be deployed incrementally:
1. Fix CreateCampaign.tsx first (most critical for user workflow)
2. Fix Advertisers.tsx second (important for advertiser management)
3. Fix Dashboard.tsx last (enhancement to existing functionality)

This approach minimizes risk and allows for thorough testing of each component.
