# GitHub Actions Workflow Run Analysis

## Workflow Run Details
Based on the provided link, this appears to be a specific GitHub Actions workflow run:
https://github.com/AJ2025dev/audiencestreet-campaign-hub/actions/runs/17514067595/workflow

## Issue Analysis
The workflow run is failing with the error:
```
Run if [ -z "$STAGING_API_BASE_URL" ]; then
STAGING_API_BASE_URL is not set. Please add it as a repository variable.
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

## Root Cause
This error indicates that somewhere in the workflow, there's a check for the `STAGING_API_BASE_URL` environment variable, but it's not set. 

## Solution
Add the `STAGING_API_BASE_URL` variable to your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to "Settings" → "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
3. Click "New repository variable"
4. Add:
   - **Name**: `STAGING_API_BASE_URL`
   - **Value**: Your Supabase project URL (e.g., `https://uzcmjulbpmeythxfusrm.supabase.co`)
   
   If you don't have a separate staging environment, just use your production Supabase URL.

## Additional Steps
1. After adding the variable, re-run the workflow
2. Check if there are any other missing variables that need to be configured
3. Verify that all required environment variables are set:
   - `API_BASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
   - `STAGING_API_BASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL (or staging URL if you have one)
   - `VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK` - Your Vercel deploy hook URL
   - `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK` - Your Render deploy hook URL (if using Render)

## Next Steps
1. Add the missing `STAGING_API_BASE_URL` repository variable
2. Re-run the workflow
3. Monitor the workflow for any additional errors
4. Proceed with Vercel deployment once the workflow completes successfully
