## End-to-End Scenario Results

### ✅ WORKING SCENARIOS
1. **Authentication Flow**: Complete authentication with enhanced error logging
2. **Domain Lists Management**: Full CRUD operations with Supabase integration
3. **User Profile Management**: Complete profile creation and role assignment
4. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket connections and live updates

### ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING SCENARIOS  
1. **Advertiser Management**: 
   - UI: ✅ Form exists, validation works
   - Backend: ❌ Only console.log, no database persistence
   - Display: ❌ Hardcoded mock data

2. **Campaign Creation**: 
   - UI: ✅ Campaign forms and workflow exist
   - Backend: ❌ No Supabase integration for campaigns table
   - Display: ❌ Static mock campaign data

3. **Dashboard Metrics**:
   - UI: ✅ Beautiful charts and metrics display
   - Data: ❌ Static mock data, not connected to real campaigns/advertisers

## Required Implementations for Full E2E Testing

### Priority 1: Advertiser CRUD Operations
```typescript
// Required: Convert Advertisers.tsx from mock data to Supabase
// Tables: profiles (role='advertiser') or dedicated advertisers table
// Operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete advertisers
```

### Priority 2: Campaign CRUD Operations  
```typescript
// Required: Convert Campaigns.tsx from mock data to Supabase
// Tables: campaigns (already exists in schema)
// Operations: Full campaign lifecycle management
```

### Priority 3: Dynamic Dashboard Metrics
```typescript
// Required: Connect Dashboard.tsx to real data
// Data Sources: campaigns, profiles, performance metrics
// Calculations: Real-time aggregation of spend, impressions, etc.
```

## What Currently Works (Ready for Testing)

### 🔐 Authentication System
- User registration with email confirmation
- Role-based access control (admin/agency/advertiser)
- Session persistence and token management
- Enhanced error logging (GitHub changes)

### 🌐 Domain Lists System
- Complete allowlist/blocklist management
- Global and campaign-specific entries
- Real-time updates and persistence
- Edit, delete, toggle functionality

### 📊 Dashboard UI
- Beautiful responsive design
- Interactive charts and metrics
- Campaign table with actions
- Real-time chart updates (when data connected)

### 🔧 Testing Infrastructure
- Automated test runner at `/test-dashboard`
- Console logging for debugging
- Real-time test status updates
- Coverage of all major user flows

## Test Execution Recommendations

### Immediate Testing (Works Now)
1. **Run authentication tests** - Complete E2E auth flow
2. **Test domain lists management** - Full CRUD operations  
3. **Validate GitHub error logging** - Enhanced error handling
4. **Test real-time connections** - WebSocket functionality

### Pending Development (Needs Implementation)
1. **Advertiser management** - Requires Supabase CRUD integration
2. **Campaign creation workflow** - Requires campaigns table integration
3. **Dynamic dashboard metrics** - Requires real data connections

## Next Steps for Full E2E Coverage

1. **Connect Advertisers to Supabase**
   - Update `handleCreateAdvertiser` to save to database
   - Replace mock data with real queries
   - Add edit/delete functionality

2. **Connect Campaigns to Supabase**  
   - Link campaign creation to campaigns table
   - Implement campaign status management
   - Add campaign metrics calculation

3. **Make Dashboard Dynamic**
   - Connect metrics to real campaign data
   - Implement live data aggregation
   - Add real-time updates for statistics

4. **Full E2E Test Suite**
   - All user scenarios working end-to-end
   - Real data persistence and retrieval
   - Complete workflow validation

**Status**: 3/4 major scenarios ready, 1 fully implemented, infrastructure complete
