## End‑to‑End Scenario Results

### ✅ WORKING SCENARIOS
1. **Authentication Flow**: Complete sign‑up, login and role‑based access control
2. **Domain Lists Management**: Full CRUD operations with Supabase integration
3. **Advertiser Management**: Create and list advertisers backed by Supabase
4. **Campaign Creation**: New campaigns persist to Supabase and appear in the advertiser’s campaign list

### ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING SCENARIOS
1. **Campaign Editing & Status Management**: Campaign table displays real data, but editing/pausing/resuming is not yet implemented
2. **Dashboard Metrics**: Summary cards aggregate budgets from campaigns, but impressions/clicks are still static

---

## Required Implementations for Full E2E Testing

### Priority 1: Campaign Lifecycle Operations
```ts
// Required: add update/pause/resume/delete functionality to campaigns
// Tables: campaigns (already exists in schema)
// UI: add controls to edit status and budgets
```

### Priority 2: Dynamic Dashboard Metrics
```ts
// Required: connect Dashboard.tsx to real performance data
// Data Sources: campaigns, impression_tracking, clicks
// Calculations: real‑time aggregation of spend, impressions and clicks
```

## What Currently Works (Ready for Testing)

### 🔐 Authentication System
* User registration with email confirmation
* Role‑based access control (admin/agency/advertiser)
* Session persistence and token management

### 🧑‍💼 Advertiser Management
* Create new advertisers via the UI
* Advertisers list loads from Supabase
* Campaign count and total spend are computed per advertiser

### 🎯 Campaign Creation
* Campaigns persist to the `campaigns` table
* Generated strategies are stored in the `description` field
* Campaign table shows budgets and dates dynamically

### 🌐 Domain Lists System
* Complete allowlist/blocklist management
* Global and campaign‑specific entries
* Real‑time updates and persistence
* Edit, delete, toggle functionality

### 📊 Dashboard UI
* Responsive design
* Interactive charts and metrics cards
* Recent campaigns table shows real entries

## Test Execution Recommendations

### Immediate Testing (Works Now)
1. **Run through advertiser creation** – verify new advertiser appears with zero campaigns
2. **Launch campaigns** – ensure campaigns persist and display correctly
3. **Test domain lists** – full CRUD operations
4. **Verify authentication and access control**

### Pending Development (Needs Implementation)
1. **Campaign editing & status management** – update/pause/resume campaigns
2. **Dynamic dashboard metrics** – integrate real performance data for impressions and clicks

---

## Next Steps for Full E2E Coverage

1. **Add campaign lifecycle controls**
2. **Connect impression/click tracking to dashboard**
3. **Merge test dashboard and status badges into this branch**
4. **Expand test suite to cover all user flows**

**Status**: Most core features are now functional with Supabase; focus next on campaign lifecycle and dashboard analytics
