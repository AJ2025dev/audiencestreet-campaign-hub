# Deployment Issues Resolution Guide

## Overview
This document addresses two deployment issues you're experiencing:
1. No recent build logs in Vercel
2. `STAGING_API_BASE_URL` not set error in GitHub Actions

## Issue 1: No Recent Build Logs in Vercel

### Root Cause
The most likely cause is that the deployment workflow hasn't been triggered recently, or there's an issue with the Vercel deploy hook configuration.

### Solution
1. **Trigger Deployment Manually**:
   - Go to GitHub repository → "Actions" tab
   - Find "Auto Deploy & QA" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" → Select `main` branch → Click "Run workflow"

2. **Verify Vercel Deploy Hook**:
   - In GitHub repository settings → "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
   - Ensure `VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK` secret exists with correct URL
   - Get this URL from Vercel project → "Settings" → "Git" → "Deploy Hooks"

3. **Check Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/aj2025devs-projects/audiencestreet-campaign-hub
   - Check "Deployments" tab for recent activity
   - If no recent deployments, trigger one manually from Vercel dashboard

## Issue 2: STAGING_API_BASE_URL Not Set

### Root Cause
A GitHub Actions workflow is trying to use a `STAGING_API_BASE_URL` environment variable that hasn't been configured.

### Solution
1. **Add Repository Variable** (if you have a staging environment):
   - Go to GitHub repository → "Settings" → "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
   - Click "New repository variable"
   - Name: `STAGING_API_BASE_URL`
   - Value: Your staging Supabase URL (e.g., `https://your-staging-project.supabase.co`)

2. **Use Production URL** (if you don't have a staging environment):
   - Add the same variable but with your production Supabase URL
   - This allows the workflow to run without errors

3. **Modify Workflow** (alternative approach):
   - Find the workflow causing the error
   - Modify it to use `API_BASE_URL` instead of `STAGING_API_BASE_URL`
   - Or add a fallback:
     ```bash
     if [ -z "$STAGING_API_BASE_URL" ]; then
       STAGING_API_BASE_URL="$API_BASE_URL"
     fi
     ```

## Complete Deployment Process

### Step 1: Configure Environment Variables
1. In GitHub repository → "Settings" → "Secrets and variables" → "Actions"
2. Ensure these variables exist:
   - `VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK` (from Vercel project settings)
   - `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK` (if using Render for backend)
   - `API_BASE_URL` (your Supabase project URL)
   - `STAGING_API_BASE_URL` (same as `API_BASE_URL` if no separate staging)

### Step 2: Trigger Deployment
1. Go to GitHub → "Actions" → "Auto Deploy & QA"
2. Click "Run workflow" → Select `main` branch → Click "Run workflow"
3. Wait for workflow to complete (approx. 5-10 minutes)

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
1. Check GitHub Actions for successful completion
2. Check Vercel dashboard for new deployment
3. Visit deployed URL and test functionality:
   - Login works correctly
   - Admin access at `/admin`
   - Agency commissions at `/agency-commissions`
   - Equativ inventory pull functionality
   - AI campaign strategy auto-creation

## Troubleshooting Checklist

### If Vercel Deployment Still Not Working:
- [ ] Verify `VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK` secret is correctly set
- [ ] Check Vercel project settings for correct build configuration
- [ ] Ensure all required environment variables are set in Vercel
- [ ] Try manual deployment from Vercel dashboard

### If STAGING_API_BASE_URL Error Persists:
- [ ] Identify which workflow is causing the error
- [ ] Add `STAGING_API_BASE_URL` repository variable
- [ ] Or modify workflow to use `API_BASE_URL` instead
- [ ] Or skip the staging validation if not needed

## Environment Variables Required

### GitHub Repository Secrets:
1. `VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK` - From Vercel project deploy hooks
2. `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK` - If using Render backend (optional)
3. `EQUATIV_API_KEY` - For Equativ integration (if used)

### GitHub Repository Variables:
1. `API_BASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL (e.g., `https://your-project.supabase.co`)
2. `STAGING_API_BASE_URL` - Same as `API_BASE_URL` if no separate staging

### Vercel Environment Variables:
1. `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
2. `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anonymous key
3. `VITE_EQUATIV_API_KEY` - Your Equativ API key (if using Equativ features)

## Next Steps

1. Configure the missing environment variables as described above
2. Trigger the "Auto Deploy & QA" workflow manually
3. Monitor both GitHub Actions and Vercel dashboard for successful deployment
4. Test all implemented features in the deployed application

If you continue to experience issues, please share:
1. Screenshots of GitHub Actions workflow failures
2. Vercel deployment status
3. Any specific error messages you're seeing
4. Whether you have separate staging/production Supabase projects
