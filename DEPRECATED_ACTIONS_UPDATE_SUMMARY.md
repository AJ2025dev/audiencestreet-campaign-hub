# Deprecated Actions Update Summary

## Issue Fixed
GitHub Actions was reporting an error about using deprecated versions of actions:
- `actions/upload-artifact@v3`
- `actions/checkout@v3`
- `actions/setup-python@v3`

## Changes Made

### File Updated
`.github/workflows.github/workflows/agent-pipeline.yml`

### Actions Updated
1. **actions/upload-artifact**:
   - Updated 7 instances from `@v3` to `@v4`

2. **actions/checkout**:
   - Updated 7 instances from `@v3` to `@v4`

3. **actions/setup-python**:
   - Updated 7 instances from `@v3` to `@v4`

## Verification
- All instances of `v3` actions have been updated to `v4` in our workflow files
- No remaining references to deprecated actions in our project's workflow files
- Third-party dependencies in `node_modules` still contain deprecated actions, but these should not affect our workflows

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push the changes
2. Re-run any failing workflows to verify the fix
3. Monitor GitHub Actions for any further deprecation warnings

## Benefits
- Resolves the deprecation error
- Uses the latest features and security updates from GitHub Actions
- Ensures continued compatibility with GitHub's infrastructure
