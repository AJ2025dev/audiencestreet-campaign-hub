# TAS Affiliate Management System - Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the TAS Affiliate Management System. The testing approach follows a comprehensive strategy that includes unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, and performance testing to ensure the quality and reliability of the system.

## Testing Principles

1. **Automated Testing**: All tests should be automated to enable continuous integration and delivery.
2. **Test Pyramid**: Follow the test pyramid approach with unit tests forming the base, followed by integration tests, and end-to-end tests at the top.
3. **Early Testing**: Testing should start early in the development cycle.
4. **Continuous Testing**: Tests should run continuously as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
5. **Test Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical business logic.

## Testing Types

### 1. Unit Testing

#### Backend Unit Tests
- Test individual functions and methods in isolation
- Mock external dependencies (database, APIs, etc.)
- Focus on business logic, data validation, and error handling
- Technologies: Jest, Supertest

#### Frontend Unit Tests
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock API calls and external dependencies
- Focus on component rendering, state management, and user interactions
- Technologies: Jest, React Testing Library

#### Coverage Targets
- Backend: 80% code coverage
- Frontend: 70% code coverage

### 2. Integration Testing

#### API Integration Tests
- Test API endpoints and their interactions with the database
- Validate request/response formats and status codes
- Test authentication and authorization flows
- Technologies: Jest, Supertest

#### Database Integration Tests
- Test database operations (CRUD)
- Validate data integrity and constraints
- Test database migrations
- Technologies: Jest, Sequelize

#### Third-Party API Integration Tests
- Test integration with Meta Ads API
- Test integration with Google Ads API
- Test integration with AI creative generation APIs
- Technologies: Jest, Nock (for mocking)

### 3. End-to-End Testing

#### Web Application E2E Tests
- Test user flows from login to core functionality
- Validate UI interactions and navigation
- Test cross-browser compatibility
- Technologies: Cypress, Playwright

#### API E2E Tests
- Test complete API workflows
- Validate data consistency across multiple API calls
- Technologies: Postman, Newman

### 4. Performance Testing

#### Load Testing
- Test system performance under expected load
- Identify bottlenecks and performance issues
- Technologies: Artillery, k6

#### Stress Testing
- Test system behavior under extreme load
- Validate system stability and error handling
- Technologies: Artillery, k6

#### API Performance Testing
- Test API response times and throughput
- Validate database query performance
- Technologies: Apache Bench, wrk

### 5. Security Testing

#### Authentication Testing
- Test authentication mechanisms
- Validate password policies and token expiration
- Technologies: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite

#### Authorization Testing
- Test role-based access controls
- Validate permissions and data access restrictions
- Technologies: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite

#### Vulnerability Scanning
- Scan for common security vulnerabilities
- Validate input validation and sanitization
- Technologies: OWASP ZAP, SonarQube

### 6. Usability Testing

#### User Experience Testing
- Test user interface and user experience
- Validate accessibility compliance
- Technologies: Manual testing, axe-core

## Test Environment

### Development Environment
- Local development machines
- Docker containers for consistent environments
- SQLite for local database testing

### Staging Environment
- Cloud-based environment mirroring production
- PostgreSQL database
- Full integration with third-party services

### Production Environment
- Cloud-based production environment
- PostgreSQL database with replication
- Full integration with all services

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Generation
- Use factories and fixtures for consistent test data
- Anonymize production data for testing
- Maintain separate test databases

### Test Data Cleanup
- Automatically clean up test data after each test run
- Use database transactions for rollback
- Implement data reset scripts

## Continuous Integration

### CI Pipeline
- Run unit tests on every commit
- Run integration tests on pull requests
- Run security scans regularly
- Deploy to staging environment on successful tests

### Test Reporting
- Generate test reports for each test run
- Track test coverage metrics
- Monitor test execution times
- Integrate with project management tools

## Test Automation Framework

### Backend Testing Framework
- Jest for unit and integration tests
- Supertest for API testing
- Sequelize for database testing

### Frontend Testing Framework
- Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests
- Cypress for end-to-end tests
- Storybook for component testing

## Test Execution Schedule

### Continuous Testing
- Unit tests: On every code commit
- Integration tests: On pull request creation
- Security scans: Daily

### Periodic Testing
- End-to-end tests: Weekly
- Performance tests: Monthly
- Usability tests: Quarterly

## Test Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- Test coverage percentage
- Test execution time
- Number of failing tests
- Mean time to resolution for test failures

### Monitoring
- Test execution dashboard
- Performance metrics dashboard
- Error tracking and alerting

## Test Maintenance

### Test Review Process
- Regular review of test cases for relevance
- Update tests when functionality changes
- Remove obsolete tests

### Test Optimization
- Optimize slow-running tests
- Parallelize test execution where possible
- Minimize test dependencies

## Conclusion

This testing strategy provides a comprehensive approach to ensure the quality and reliability of the TAS Affiliate Management System. By following this strategy, we can identify and fix issues early in the development cycle, reduce the risk of production bugs, and ensure a high-quality user experience.
