# TAS Affiliate Management System - Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the TAS Affiliate Management System. The testing strategy covers all aspects of the application including backend APIs, frontend components, database interactions, security, and performance.

## Testing Principles

1. **Automated Testing**: All critical functionality should have automated tests
2. **Continuous Integration**: Tests should run automatically with each code change
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all user roles and workflows
4. **Security Testing**: Ensure authentication, authorization, and data protection
5. **Performance Testing**: Validate system performance under load
6. **Usability Testing**: Ensure intuitive user experience

## Test Environment

### Development Environment
- Node.js 16+
- PostgreSQL 12+
- Local development servers

### Staging Environment
- Similar to production but with test data
- Used for integration testing

### Production Environment
- Live environment with real data
- Used for final validation

## Testing Types

#### Data Security
- **Encryption**: Test data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Input Validation**: Test for SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities
- **Rate Limiting**: Test API rate limiting

### 5. Performance Testing

#### Load Testing
- **Concurrent Users**: Test system with 100, 500, and 1000 concurrent users
- **Database Performance**: Test query performance with large datasets
- **API Response Times**: Test API response times under load

#### Stress Testing
- **Peak Load**: Test system during peak usage periods
- **Resource Limits**: Test system behavior when resources are limited

### 6. Usability Testing

#### User Experience
- **Navigation**: Test ease of navigation between pages
- **Form Validation**: Test form validation and error messages
- **Responsive Design**: Test on different screen sizes and devices

#### Accessibility
- **Screen Readers**: Test compatibility with screen readers
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Test full keyboard navigation
- **Color Contrast**: Test color contrast for accessibility

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Strategy
- **Anonymized Production Data**: Use anonymized production data for realistic testing
- **Synthetic Data**: Generate synthetic data for specific test scenarios
- **Data Reset**: Reset test data between test runs

### Test Data Categories
- **User Accounts**: Test accounts for each user role
- **Offers**: Sample offers with different payout types
- **Campaigns**: Sample campaigns with different configurations
- **Conversions**: Sample conversion data for tracking
- **Creatives**: Sample creative assets
