- [ ] Verify database queries use parameterized statements
- [ ] Check that error handling is implemented correctly
- [ ] Confirm that authentication is properly enforced

### 2. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for all new functions
- [ ] Integration tests for database operations
- [ ] End-to-end tests for user flows
- [ ] Performance testing with realistic data loads
- [ ] Security testing (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)

### 3. Database Preparation
- [ ] Review and update database schema if needed
- [ ] Create any required database functions or views
- [ ] Ensure proper indexes are in place
- [ ] Verify Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- [ ] Backup production database

### 4. Environment Configuration

- [ ] Check Supabase connection settings
- [ ] Confirm API keys are properly secured
- [ ] Review CORS settings

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Staging Deployment
1. Deploy changes to staging environment
2. Run automated tests against staging
3. Perform manual QA testing
4. Verify database migrations (if any)
5. Check monitoring and logging

### 2. Production Deployment
1. Schedule deployment during low-traffic period
2. Announce maintenance window to users
3. Deploy frontend changes
4. Deploy backend/database changes
5. Run post-deployment tests
6. Monitor application performance
7. Update documentation

### 3. Rollback Plan
1. If issues are detected, rollback to previous version
2. Restore database from backup if needed
3. Communicate issues to stakeholders
4. Schedule fix and redeployment

## Monitoring and Verification

### 1. Immediate Post-deployment
- [ ] Verify application loads correctly
- [ ] Test campaign creation flow
- [ ] Test advertiser creation flow
- [ ] Verify dashboard shows real data
- [ ] Check error logging

### 2. Ongoing Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Check database performance
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Review user feedback
- [ ] Check resource utilization

## Security Considerations

### 1. Authentication
- [ ] Verify all routes are properly protected
- [ ] Confirm session management is secure
- [ ] Check password reset functionality
- [ ] Review token expiration settings

### 2. Authorization
- [ ] Verify Row Level Security policies
- [ ] Check role-based access controls
- [ ] Confirm data isolation between users
- [ ] Review admin access controls

### 3. Data Protection
- [ ] Ensure sensitive data is encrypted
- [ ] Verify database backups are secure
- [ ] Check API key security
- [ ] Review data retention policies

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Database
- [ ] Monitor query performance
- [ ] Check index usage
- [ ] Review connection pooling
- [ ] Optimize slow queries

### 2. Frontend

- [ ] Update developer documentation
- [ ] Create release notes
- [ ] Update API documentation

### 2. Training
- [ ] Train support team on new features
- [ ] Provide developer training if needed
- [ ] Update onboarding materials

### 3. Communication
- [ ] Announce successful deployment
- [ ] Communicate new features to users
- [ ] Provide feedback channels for issues

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issues are discovered after deployment:

1. Immediately rollback frontend to previous version
2. If database changes were made, restore from backup
3. Communicate issue to stakeholders
4. Investigate and fix root cause
5. Reschedule deployment with fixes

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Application loads without errors
- [ ] Campaign creation saves to database
- [ ] Advertiser creation saves to database
- [ ] Dashboard shows real data
- [ ] Performance meets SLA requirements
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities detected
